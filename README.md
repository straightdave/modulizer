# modulizer
a ruby gem that modulize the web pages

## basic idea
while building web applications, 
you may need to separate a complex web page into pieces which are more isolated, 
independent, easy-to-maintain and, the most important, reusable.
similar to 'partial' components in many backend frameworks (eg. sinatra, rails).
further more, it'll be good if you can package all things together, like the html templates, styles and scripts.

this'll make it easy to develop a web site with complex pages.
